Here, Program x.y configuration is used.
x represents  the program number and is basically the order in which I tried a certain program.
y represents the intenal edit number. The mods I've made to the program.
For Example: A program with Number 3.1 means that it is the third program that I've written and have made 1 change to the original code that I had written on first run.
PS: 3.1 happens to be the program directly after which this Readme file was written.
